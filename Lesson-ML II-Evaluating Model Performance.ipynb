The function we have written represents a **machine learning model**, which means that it outputs a prediction based on the input to the model.\n",

    "A simple way to test the quality of our model is to:\n",

    "- split the dataset into 2 partitions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the training set: contains the majority of the rows (75%)\n",
    " - the test set: contains the remaining minority of the rows (25%)\n",
    "- use the rows in the training set to predict the price value for the rows in the test set\n",
    " - add new column named predicted_price to the test set\n",
    "- compare the predicted_price values with the actual price values in the test set to see how accurate the predicted values were.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation process, where we use the training set to make predictions and the test set to predict values for, is known as **train/test validation**. Whenever we're performing machine learning, we want to perform validation of some kind to ensure that our machine learning model can make good predictions on new data. While train/test validation isn't perfect, we'll use it to understand the validation process, to select an error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will modify the `predict_price` function to use only the rows in the training set, instead of the full dataset, to find the nearest neighbors, average the price values for those rows, and return the predicted price value. Then, we'll use this function to predict the price for just the rows in the test set. Once we have the predicted price values, we can compare with the true price values and start to understand the model's effectiveness\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "While the MAE (7.5) to RMSE (7.9056941504209481) ratio was about 1:1 for the first list of errors, the MAE (62.5) to RMSE (235.82302686548658) ratio was closer to 1:4 for the second list of errors. In general, we should expect that the MAE value be much less than the RMSE value. The only difference between the 2 sets of errors is the extreme 1000 value in errors_two instead of 10. When we're working with larger data sets, we can't inspect each value to understand if there's one or some outliers or if all of the errors are systematically higher. Looking at the ratio of MAE to RMSE can help us understand if there are large but infrequent errors. \n",
